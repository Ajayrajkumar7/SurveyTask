# SurveyTask
This app lets us get responses from a user through a website with a UI that captures the user's attention. It is created using next.js. I have also created a survey through Survey Sparrow which is a party-related survey. It gets information such as how many people are coming, the names, etc. I have also mapped the responses from google forms to the Survey Sparrow tool. 
Website is created using next.js.
Google forms has been connected and mapped to survey sparrow survey.
